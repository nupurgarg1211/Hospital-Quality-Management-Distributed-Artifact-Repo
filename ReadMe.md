### Hospital-Quality-Management-Distributed-Artifact-Repo

##Approach:
 * Exploring Medical records and its structure.
 * Standard for message passing-HL7 Message, between healthcare device and server.
 * Find Persistent Storage mechanism for storing HL7 message on AWS.
 * Implementation of Queue for handling incoming messages.
 * Implementation for centralized web data store (AWS cloud).
 
##Result of study :
* HL7 Messages are used to transfer electronic data between disparate healthcare systems. Thus, HL7 format is used.
* HAPI is an open source, OO HL7 parses for JAVA.
* Companies in the healthcare sector are building applications on MongoDB to reduce costs, meet compliance standards and improve healthcare outcomes.
* AWS : Elastic, Cost Effective, Reliable, Flexible, Secure.
* An architecture is proposed on the basis of above mentioned parameters.That is available in the presentation.

##Future Scope :
* As currently developed system is flexible and scalable, it can be extended to include various data format like,
 * All HL7 format
 * Images
 * EMR
 * QMS
 * Analytics
* Integration with other modules.
